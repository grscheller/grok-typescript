# Grokking Typescript Log

## Purpose 

To document the steps I have taken to capture my attemps to learn
the TypeScript web development language, its tooling, and the npm
package management ecosystem.

## Logs:

### 2024-01-21:

Getting an npm account setup.

Well, https://www.npmjs.com/ is done by GitHub. Went there and created
a free npm account:

```
  username: grscheller
  password: <random gibberish>
```

Setup Two-Factor authentication with Google Authenticator. Saved
recovery code in a safe place.

Linked npm accout with my grscheller GitHub account.

Edited my nmp profile. Gave my full name. Could not change my profile
picture. Uses some proprietary service called Gravatar, whose tagline
is "One profile for everything, everywhere." Well, that is not what
I want. No way to upload a One Piece related avatar image.

Probably will not touch npm for a while.

### 2024-01-21:

Created grscheller/grok-typescript Repo on GitHub.

This repo is the project. It will document my learning of TypeScript and
host my notes. It will contain mostly Markdown files, HTML files, and
standalone node files (whatever they are). The license used will be
`The Unlicence`.

Any npm packages I write in support of this effort will have their own
associated npm repos and will use the `Apache 2.0 License`. I may run
small HTML JavaScript/TypeScript examples from the repo's `gh-pages`.

### 2024-01-21:

Created my first two sets of notes:

* [npm CLI Interface](npm/npm-cli-interface.md)
* [Node.js .gitignore](node/node-dot-github.md)
